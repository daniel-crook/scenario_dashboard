Slow Growth,"Lower than Current Trajectory:
Apply ABS Series C NOM dispersion to BIS OE baseline",Lower than Current Trajectory case,Lower demand than Current Trajectory case,~4⁰C by 2100 from pre-industrial levels,Higher than Current Trajectory case,Higher than Current Trajectory case,Slower pace of recovery and international border reopening is delayed
Central,BISE OE baseline,BIS OE Baseline,BISE OE Baseline,~2.6⁰C by 2100 from pre-industrial levels,BIS OE baseline,BIS OE baseline,BIS OE baseline
Sustainable Growth,BISE OE baseline,"Aggregate level is consistent with Current Trajectory, but sector composition reflects more aggressive decarbonisation","Aggregate level is consistent with Current Trajectory, but sector composition reflects more aggressive decarbonisation",~1.8⁰C by 2100 from pre-industrial levels,Lower than Current Trajectory case,Higher than Current Trajectory case,BIS OE baseline
Rapid Decarbonisation,"Higher than Current Trajectory case:
Apply ABS Series A NOM dispersion to BIS OE baseline",Higher than Current Trajectory case,Higher demand than Current Trajectory case,<1.5⁰C by 2100 from pre-industrial levels,Lower than Current Trajectory case,Lower than Current Trajectory case,Faster pace of recovery and international border re-opening is fast-tracked
Export Superpower,"Higher than Current Trajectory case:
Apply ABS Series A NOM dispersion to BIS OE baseline ",Higher than Current Trajectory case,Higher demand than Current Trajectory case,<1.5⁰C by 2100 from pre-industrial levels,Lower than Current Trajectory case,Lower than Current Trajectory case,Faster pace of recovery and international border re-opening is fast-tracked
